            <h2>Our vision</h2>
            Our vision is that every young person develops:
            <ol>
                <li>The knowledge, skills, and confidence to use computers and digital technologies effectively in their
                    work,
                    community, and personal life; to solve problems and to express themselves creatively</li>
                <li>Sufficient understanding of societal and ethical issues to be able to critically evaluate digital
                    technologies and their application, and to design and use technology for good</li>
                <li>The mindsets that enable them to confidently engage with technological change and to continue
                    learning about
                    new and emerging technologies</li>
            </ol>

                <h2>Our long-term goals</h2>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Education: To enable any school to teach students about computing and how to create with digital
                        technologies, through providing the best possible curriculum, resources, and training for
                        teachers.</li>

                    <li>Non-formal learning: To engage millions of young people in learning about computing and how to
                        create with digital technologies outside of school, through online resources and apps, clubs,
                        competitions, and partnerships with youth organisations.</li>
                    <li>Research: To deepen our understanding of how young people learn about computing and how to
                        create
                        with digital technologies, and to use that knowledge to increase the impact of our work and
                        advance
                        the field of computing education.</li>
